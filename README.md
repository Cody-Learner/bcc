# Build in Clean Chroot

Builds Arch linux AUR and official packages in a clean chroot using the official Arch devtools package.<br>
The 'devtools-info' and 'devtools-scripts' files provide information on the devtools package.<br>
This was preliminary work leading up to writing my 'aurch' AUR helper.<br>
<br>
Note: dependencies must be installed prior to using this script.<br>
Dependencies: base-devel devtools expac asp git auracle-git<br>
<br>

**Updated for Jan 15, 2023:**<br>
Ran a test build successfully on AUR python2: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python2 <br>
Cleaned up this README.md file and clarify help and comments in the script.<br>
